Given a variable number of playing cards, form the best hand that does not
exceed 21. The cards are in the set [23456789JQKA], where 2-9 are worth their
face value, J Q and K are worth 10, and A can be selected to be worth either 1
and 11. In this scenario, you are only playing with one suit, so there is never
more than one of each card.

A user should have a form with a single text field and a submit button. Bonus points for nice styling.

Input:

A sequence of characters (Cards) in the above set.

Output:

For each input line of cards, print the highest possible score that does not
exceed 21.

Example:

STDIN:

296J
85
A37
475A

STDOUT:

21
13
21
20
